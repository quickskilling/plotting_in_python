__Notes on Marimo__  

We need to install the [marimo](https://marimo.io) package in Python using `pip install "marimo[recommended]"` in the Terminal or `!pip install "marimo[recommended]"` in your Python interactive window in VS code.

In your terminal run `marimo edit` or `marimimo edit [path_to_py_file]` and marimo will start running. This will give you a space to complete your project.
